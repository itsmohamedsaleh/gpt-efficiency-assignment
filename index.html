                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>This project, <strong>ChatGPT Validator</strong>, aims to evaluate how well ChatGPT performs in different areas. We built a website that connects to a database and uses ChatGPT to answer questions. By comparing ChatGPT's answers to the correct ones, we can see how accurate and efficient the model is.</p>
                <p>The workflow includes several key steps:</p>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Database Setup:</strong> Using the terminal and Visual Studio Code (VSCode), we created a MongoDB database to store our data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Backend Development:</strong> We used Node.js and Express to connect to the MongoDB database, allowing us to manage data effectively.</li>
                    <li><strong>API Integration:</strong> We integrated the ChatGPT API to generate responses based on user questions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Upload:</strong> Three CSV files with questions and answers were uploaded to populate the database.</li>
                    <li><strong>Response Collection:</strong> ChatGPT's answers to the questions were stored in the database for comparison.</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance Analysis:</strong> We compared ChatGPT's answers to the correct ones to measure accuracy and response time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Results Display:</strong> The results were shown using charts and statistics to highlight ChatGPT's performance.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p>This project not only shows how ChatGPT works but also provides a way to measure its effectiveness in different subjects.</p>

                <h2>Research Approach</h2>
                <p>The research for the <strong>ChatGPT Validator</strong> project followed a clear and organized method to ensure accurate results. Here are the main steps we took:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Setting Up the Environment:</strong> We used Visual Studio Code (VSCode) to start the project and set up all necessary tools.</li>
                    <li><strong>Creating the Database:</strong> Through the terminal, we set up a MongoDB database to store questions, answers, and ChatGPT responses. We defined the database structure to keep the data organized.</li>
                    <li><strong>Developing the Backend:</strong> Using Node.js and Express, we built the server-side application. This handled API requests, managed the database, and connected the frontend with the backend.</li>
                    <li><strong>Integrating the ChatGPT API:</strong> We connected to the ChatGPT API using the `chat.completion` endpoint. This allowed our application to send questions to ChatGPT and receive answers automatically.</li>
                    <li><strong>Uploading Data:</strong> We uploaded three CSV files containing a variety of questions and their correct answers. These were imported into the MongoDB database.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collecting ChatGPT Responses:</strong> For each question in the database, we sent a request to ChatGPT and saved its response in the database.</li>
                    <li><strong>Comparing Answers:</strong> We compared ChatGPT's answers with the correct ones to measure accuracy and response time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visualizing Results:</strong> The comparison results were displayed using charts and statistics to make the data easy to understand.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>This structured approach helped us thoroughly evaluate ChatGPT's performance and provided clear insights into its strengths and areas for improvement.</p>
